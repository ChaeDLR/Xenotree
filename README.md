# Known issues
Players projectile firing cooldown is not consistent 

When you get a game over and go to main menu then start the game the turret will start firing two lasers every cooldown when it should be firing one
I'm guessing that this is due to the new level starting a second timer so there are two laser spawn timers going at once

Player can get staggered off screen

## To do list
* Add spell effects to enemies and special platforms
* Smoooth out health bar
* Give player an ability to dash or short teleport (probably mapped to shift)
* Add sound effects
* Add spell collision animation
* Cut up more platform sprites to use
* Add another enemy and create a spawning algorithm
